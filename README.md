# Causal_Inference_Using_Deep_Learning

Causation means that one variable causes another to change, which means one variable is dependent on the other. It is also called cause and effect. One example would be as weather gets hot, people experience more sunburns. In this case, the weather caused an effect which is sunburn.
The phenomenon is exemplified in ordinary causal transitive reasoning. 

When told, for example, that A causes B and that B causes C, people can infer that A causes C, or when told, for instance, that Sanding causes dust and Dust causes sneezing, they conclude that Sanding causes sneezing.

The Repository also consist of trained saved model. If you want to used it here are steps to use the same:

1: Download the prediction_script.py file

2: Download the Weights folder, it is the trained deep learning model 

3: Then you can run the prediction_script.py module which includes the loading of trained deep learning model which is here in Weights folder.
